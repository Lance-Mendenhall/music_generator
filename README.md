# music_generator_classic_rock

This program picks 100 classic rock songs and generates an output file. It uses a churning algorithm so the longer a song goes without being selected, the greater the chance it will be selected. 

I use a website called Soundiiz. I drag the output file there and it imports it into my YouTube library.
